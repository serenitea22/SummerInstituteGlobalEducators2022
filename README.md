## Intro to basic coding and Open Fuego

## README: Getting Started working with Open Fuego


2. Click the green "**Code**" button at the top of this repository and then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Open Zip and move this folder to "**My Files**." You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and open a text editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io) for Macs and Windows, or [CodePad](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB) for Chromebooks.  

5. Use the text editor to open the index.html document from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! Use these [common image files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-vnVUo7oW5A48UpPyoWaTf3TaPQIBcTD?usp=sharing) to enhance your webtext. 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save."

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.

## Sharing Out

Once you have published your webtext to GitHub, please share the URL with the Summer Institute for Global Educators [share the URL](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAyioP6eq3JD1tZFQMDqIYKFO9iel3wrykV_Bme_a2PY2OZg/viewform?usp=sf_link).<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Reflection

* Should everyone learn a little about code?
* How do global citizens use data and code to advocate for social and environmental justice in their community?
* Is open access to code and data science an ethical imperative?
* Is there value in intertwining coding education with global studies education?
* Are there any dangers as to how student observations might be shared?
* What jobs could this coding knowledge be useful in?
* How can schools better ensure that *everyone* has a voice in the conversation about code and data?
